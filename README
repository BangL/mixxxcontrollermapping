Description of Mappings
===============

Hot Cue
=======
(click MODE -> off = Cue Mode)
1,2 : Select/Store Hotcue 1,2
3,4 : Delete Hotcue 1,2

Loop
=====
1,2 loop in / out
3: halve looping time
4: looping off

Headpone Plus/Minus Buttons:
==================
Press both buttons together puts the Headphone Volume to Zero // Full Volume.

Pitch
====
To have a more precide way to work, Pitching makes fine tuning, Plus/Minus Buttons are temporary 
pitchings. 
Pressing Plus- and Minus-Buttons together resets the Pitch to Zero.
(Feel free to change  :)
