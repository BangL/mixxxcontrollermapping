### Mapping descriptions


#### Hot cues

(click MODE -> off = Cue Mode)  
1,2 : Select/Store Hotcue 1,2  
3,4 : Delete Hotcue 1,2  

#### Loops

1,2 loop in / out  
3: halve looping time  
4: looping off  

#### Headpones +/- buttons:

Buttons are not mapped. The Controller takes care of adjusting the volume  
of the controllers headphone plug. Mixxx also adjustes the volume independend  
of the controller.  

#### Tempo / Pitch bend

To have a more precide way to work, Pitching makes fine tuning, Plus/Minus Buttons are temporary  
pitchings.  
Pressing Plus- and Minus-Buttons together resets the Pitch to Zero.  
(Feel free to change  :)  



### Todo:

* Headphone +- Switches -> Headphone-Volume
* Effects
* Better Looping Mappings
* Simulate Gain with Vinyl + Pitch
* Simulate Mastervolume with Headphone-+ & Vinyl
* Image for Documentation of Mappings / Wiki

### Done:

* Automapping
* Jog Wheels
* Pitch +/- & PitchSwitch
* Pitch - and + simultaneously = Reset Pitch to Zero
* Hotcue Deletions
    1,2,3,4 : Select/Store Hotcue 1,2,3,4
    Vinyl + 1,2,3,4 : Delete Hotcue
* LED's     
* Playlist Navigation
